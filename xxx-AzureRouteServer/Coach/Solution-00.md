## Notes & Guidance

Ask your coach about the subscription you are going to use to fulfill the challenges
Install the recommended toolset, being one of this:
The Powershell way (same tooling for Windows, Linux or Mac):
Powershell core (7.x)
Azure Powershell modules
Visual Studio Code: the Windows Powershell ISE might be an option here for Windows users, but VS Code is far, far better
vscode Powershell extension
The Azure CLI way:
Windows Subsystem for Linux, if you are running Windows and want to install the Azure CLI under a Linux shell like bash or zsh
Azure CLI
Visual Studio Code: the Windows Powershell ISE might be an option here for Windows users, but VS Code is far, far better
VScode Azure CLI extension
The Azure Portal way: not really recommended, but you can still use the portal to fulfill most of the challenges. Do not complain about having to do more than once the same task across the challenges :)
NOTE: You can use Azure Powershell and CLI on the Azure Cloud Shell, but running the commands locally along Visual Studio Code will give you a much better experience

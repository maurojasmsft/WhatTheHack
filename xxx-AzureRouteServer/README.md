# What The Hack - Azure Route Server

## Introduction

This challenge builds up on a traditional Hub and Spoke topology introducing Azure Route Server. The Students will engage into an increasingly adopted technology that provides the ability exchange routes more dynamically. Students will get familiar with basic trending implementations of Azure Route Server adopted in the industry.  

## Learning Objectives

- BGP Review
- Understand how Azure Route Server leverages BGP to enable Dynamic Routing
- Understand  Azure Route Server within a hub and Spoke Topology with a central Network Virtual Appliance.  
- Understand Azure Route Server Route Exchange with On Premises 
- Understand Azure Route Server Route Exchange with On Premises and SDWAN. 
- Understand Azure Route Server Route Exchange with High Availability.
